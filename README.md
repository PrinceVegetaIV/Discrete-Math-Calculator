Project Title: Discrete Math Calculator

Introduction: An interactive interface of a calculator with functionalities of Discrete
Mathematics.
Description+Objectives: In our project, we are going to make a calculator which will be able
to perform most of the operations of a scientific calculator. On top of that, the operations we
learned from the chapters of our Discrete Math book will also be included in the calculator. The
following options will be given to the user:
1. Propositional Logic: Performing logical operations, showing truth table for logical
expressions.
2. Set, Functions and Matrices: Performing set, function and matrice operations.
3. Number Theory: Calculating GCD, LCM, Prime factorization, performing modular
arithmetics, calculating inverse modulo, solving for Bezout’s coefficient using EGCD
algorithm etc.
4. Combinatorics and Probability: Performing C(n,r) and P(n,r), calculating probability.
5. Graphs and Trees: Taking user input of a graph, then performing operations on it. For
example: Calculating shortest path, calculating height of a tree etc.
6. Boolean Algebra: Performing various operations of boolean algebra.
If possible we are planning to add some array relate features (Calculating max subarray sum,
performing binary search operations, calculating median etc.) as well. Further changes and
improvements will be made according to the instructions of the course coordinator sir.

Software requirements:
1. Language: C++. To implement all operations. We are going to use graphics.h, a built-in
library in C++ to make calculator interface.
2. IDE: Code::Blocks / Visual Studio Code.
3. OS: Windows 11 (x64)
4. Version control software: Github
Workplan:
As for our workplan, to execute our project we’ll start by implementing topics stated above. After
that we’ll learn to use graphics.h. Then combining our implementation and graphical interface of
the calculator, we finish our project.

Estimated timeframes:
1. Implementing everything except graphical interface: 2/3 weeks
2. Learning Github: 1 week
3. Learning and implementing calculator using Graphics.h: 2 weeks
4. Improving looks and functionality: According to instructions given by the course
coordinator sir.

Conclusion: As a beginner, this project can be so fun and educational for us.
